        <p>Contrary to popular belief, the creation of an artist's songs often spans several years. One such example is "Open Road." Initial recordings date back to 2021, and with the collaborative efforts of my colleagues Beatmad and the remarkable vocal talents of Nate Van Deusen, we crafted a tribute reminiscent of the finest guitar-infused deep house tracks, such as "Waves" by Robin Schulz and Mr. Probz or "Are You With Me" by Lost Frecuencies.</p>
        <p>Our goal was to create a song that would resonate with listeners, evoking feelings of nostalgia and longing for the open road. The lyrics, penned by Nate Van Deusen, reflect the universal themes of love, loss, and the passage of time.</p>
        <p>The instrumental, features a blend of acoustic and electric guitar elements, creating a unique soundscape that transports listeners to a place of tranquility and introspection, while keeping a heavenly and summerish vibe.</p>
        <p>The culmination of our efforts resulted in a release that promises to captivate audiences, securing a coveted spot on esteemed record labels specializing in deep and chill house music, such as "Paraiso" with publication under the auspices of Warner Music Benelux.</p>
