        <p>Despite what everyone thinks, an artist's songs take years to come out, and for example, Open Road is one of those songs. The initial recordings were from 2021, and with the help of my colleagues Beatmad and the incredible voices of Nate Van Deusen, we managed to create a kind of tribute to one of the best songs in guitar deep house, like "Waves" by Robin Schulz and Mr. Probz.</p>

        <p>We achieved a release that will not leave anyone indifferent, making it possible to come out in one of the best genres, deep and chill house, such as "Paraiso," under the publication with Warner Benelux.</p>
